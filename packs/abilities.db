Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this. The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.) Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The authorities are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the authority, in his logica vetus and logica nova. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The authority is Cicero, especially his De Inventione. Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The authority is Boethius, De arithmetica. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the authority is Euclid, in his Elementa. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclids Optica is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the authority is Ptolemy, in the Libri Almagesti. Music is purely theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in De Musica. Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on. \nSpecialties: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic.

If you’re looking for something specific, you must have an appropriate sympathetic connection to the thing sought (such as bottled water from a stream when searching for running water). Before you roll, designate the area in which you are searching — if the item sought is not present in that area, you automatically fail. The time required to search depends on the size of the area, and must be invested whether you succeed or not. It takes about one Diameter (two minutes, or twenty combat rounds) to search for something within 25 paces, and doubling the distance quadruples the time. To find something common, like water, within 25 paces requires a Perception + Dowsing of 9+. Increased distances or dowsing for less common things increases the target number, so that, for example, finding gold within 100 paces would have an Ease Factor of 15. \nSpecialties: searching for a particular kind of thing (water, gold, etc.), searching in a particular kind of place.

This is a special ritual (not a ritual spell) that takes about two minutes to perform. It lets you add 5 times your Parma Magica score to your magic resistance until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first.

Parma Magica does not require concentration while it is active. You may also protect one other person for each point in Parma Magica, with their consent. You must touch each person to start the protection, and it lasts as long as at least one character can see the other. The magus may cancel the protection at will, at any distance. While a magus is protecting others, his effective Parma Magica score is reduced by 3 points, both for himself and for the other people he is protecting. If the magus has a Parma Magica score of 3 or lower, his Parma Magica provides each character, including himself, with a Magic Resistance of 0. In the magus’s case, this is added to his Form resistance, and a magus protected by another magus’s Parma Magica may also add his Form resistance. Parma Magica can only be learned by Gifted characters, although they learn it as a normal Arcane Ability, not a Supernatural Ability.

The target of an attempt rolls Perception + Awareness to detect your actions. If the perceiver has Legerdemain skill, he may substitute that for Awareness if he wishes.

Score  Fluency 0  Point and grunt. With one or more expe rience points, you know “please,” ”thank you,” and a few other words. 1  Basic questions and answers: “Where is the church?,” “Do you sell food?” Constant mistakes, and an atrocious accent. People must speak slowly and often repeat themselves, and you cannot string a conversation together. 2  Basic conversation.  You can sustain a short conversation on a common topic. You still make many mistakes, and often fail to catch what others say. 3  Haltingly functional. You can hold a conversation on everyday topics, although it takes time, you make many mistakes, and your accent is still bad. 4  Functional. You can hold a conversation on non-technical topics, and make few mistakes. People do not normally need to repeat themselves. This is the minimum level required to study from a book. 5  Fluent. You still have an accent if this is not your native language, but it is weak. You speak as well as most natives. This is the minimum level required to write a book. 6  Elegant. You choose your words well, and have no accent if this is not your native language. When two people speak to each other, the lower Ability score determines how well they communicate. Characters who speak related languages can communicate at a penalty to their scores (assigned by the storyguide) depending on how closely related the two languages are. Note that Latin and Hebrew are not living languages in most of Mythic Europe. However, characters who live in places where they are (such as some covenants) may learn this Ability without any special Virtues. Characters with this Ability are illiterate unless they also have a score in Artes Liberales (page 62). This Ability also covers artistic compositions in the language, and telling existing tales with verve and passion. Knowledge of stories is covered by the appropriate Lore Abilities. \nSpecialties:  poetry, prose, specific dialects, expansive vocabulary, specific technical vocabulary, slang, storytelling.
