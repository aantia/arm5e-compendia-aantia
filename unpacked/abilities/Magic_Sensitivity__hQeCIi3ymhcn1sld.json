    "description": "You are often able to identify a place or object as magical. However, your sensitivity makes you more susceptible to magical effects: subtract your Magic Sensitivity score from all magic resistance rolls you make. When attempting to sense the magic nature of a place or object, the storyguide will assign an Ease Factor — simply roll a simple die + Perception + Magic Sensitivity. Detecting a Magic aura would normally have an Ease Factor equal to 12 – aura level, so 9 for a level 3 aura and 6 for a level 6 aura. For spells and enchanted items, an Ease Factor equal to 21 – magnitude of effect is a good guide. For enchanted items, use the magnitude of the most powerful effect in the item. For magical creatures, 15 – one fifth of the creatures Magic Might is appropriate, so for a creature with a Magic Might of 25, the Ease Factor would be 10. \nSpecialties:  auras, magical creatures, enchanted items, active spells.
