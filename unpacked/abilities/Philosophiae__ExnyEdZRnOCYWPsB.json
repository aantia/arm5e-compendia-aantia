    "description": "There are three philosophies — natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. Aristotle is the authority for all of them, in different books. Most scholars study the philosophies after the Arts but before going on to Law, Theology or Medicine. Natural phi losophy is the study of the sub-lunar world. It roughly corresponds to todays science. The main texts are the Physica, De Meteorologia, and De historia animalium. Moral philosophy is the study of the proper way of human life. It covers ethics, politics, and economics — the texts are   the   Ethica,   Politica,   and   Economica. Metaphysics is the philosophy of the fundamental nature of the world. The main text is Aristotles Metaphysica. \nSpecialties: natural philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic. (Academic)",
