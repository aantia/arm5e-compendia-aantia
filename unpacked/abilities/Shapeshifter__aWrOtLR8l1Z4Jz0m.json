This requires a few seconds’ (one rounds) concentration, and a roll of Stamina + Shapeshift against an Ease Factor of 9. Changing back to human form requires the same concentration, and the same roll. You have a limited repertoire of shapes, one for every point you have in the Shapeshift ability. Every time you raise the Ability by one point, you may choose a new shape. \nSpecialties: One of your shapes, particular conditions for the change. (Supernatural)",
