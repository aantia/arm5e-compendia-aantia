        "content": "<p>There are different types of Actors that can be created:</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The traditional troupe members of a Saga. The character sheets should be familiar to the Ars Magica player as most fields are self explanatory. The focus will be on Foundry specific features.</p><p>Sheets and owned items are color coded. Unowned Items are black</p><h3>Troupe members (blue)</h3><h4><strong>Magus, Companion and Grog</strong></h4><h3>Non-played characters (NPCs) (brown)</h3><h4><strong>Magus, Mundane and Entity</strong></h4><p></p><h2>Sheet features</h2><p>Find below a description of the sheet features tab by tab.</p><ul><li><p>A magus has additional tab for Hermetic Arts and Laboratory.</p></li><li><p>An entity is aligned to a realm, has a might score and can have powers. It is affected by auras.</p></li></ul><h3>Header</h3><h4><strong>Characteristics: </strong>Click on a characteristic label to open a roll dialog. Mouse over the score will also tell you the number of aging point in that characteristic, the more aging points, the larger a shadow will appear around the field. To edit the aging points, shift+click the label of the characteristic.<strong><br /><br />Covenant field:</strong> Set it to an existing covenant name in the world to link with the character. The character will also become a member in the covenant sheet. Click on the link symbol to open the covenant sheet. You can also drag and drop a covenant actor on the sheet for the same effect.</h4><p></p><h3>Description</h3><p>Some fields like size, soak and encumbrance are read only because they are computed and/or can only be changed through @UUID[.Gm3bQXMrk6WUTBaJ]{Active effects}:</p><p><strong>Warping</strong>: WIP, Twilight and its effects are not implemented yet</p><p><strong>Aging and decrepitude</strong>: Click on the little hourglass icon to do an aging roll.

Click on the check box to equip or unequip.</p><p></p><h3>Abilities</h3><p>This section will list all the abilities possessed by the character.

Clicking on a category will collapse or expand the corresponding list of abilities</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>Virtues and Flaws</h3><p>As with abilities, you can drag and drop virtues and flaws. A label in <em>italic </em>means it has an Active Effect.</p><p></p><h3>Arts</h3><p>This tab is only available to magic users</p><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/HermeticArts.webp\" /><p>Each of the Arts is described in this section:</p><ul><li><p>The Art symbol or its hand gesture (see @UUID[.pbpZGXKxANcTpr8R#settings]{Settings})</p></li><li><p>Its name, click on it to roll for spontaneous magic.</p></li><li><p>The amount xp spent in it and the total needed for next level.

A little glow will indicate the list is filtered.</p></li><li><p>The filter parameters are stored in the browser on per user and character basis so two different users can have their own specific view of the same sheet at the same time. As long as you keep using the same tab they will be preserved.</p></li></ul><h3>Spontaneous magical effects</h3><p>Same as spells list, but for frequently used spontaneous effects.</p><h3>Magical abilities</h3><ul><li><p>This section is a remnant of the earlier sheet, before the use of ability keys. It will probably be removed in the future. <strong>You don't actually need to match the abilities unless their ability key is not configured properly</strong></p></li><li><p>It can still be used to quickly create corresponding abilities in the character by clicking the little cog icon (it will use the ones in the system compendium).</p></li></ul><h3>Casting totals</h3><p>This table gives you a quick overview of the magical capabilities of a character. Fields are self explanatory.</p><h3>Laboratory</h3><p><strong>Dev notes:</strong> This tab is still a work in progress and will evolve greatly as lab activities are put in place. For now, it can be used to store information as is.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Sanctum</strong>: You can link a laboratory to your character, its quality and Art specialities will be taken into account in the Lab total sub tab.</p></li><li><p><strong>Longevity modifier:</strong> the modifier given by the character longevity potion. (<strong>Dev note:</strong> It may change in the future when longevity potions crafting are implemented</p></li><li><p><strong>Familiar cords:</strong> they are used in a few places (bronze for soak and aging)</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>Lab totals</h3><p>Similar to casting totals, this table gives an overview of the lab capabilities of a character.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Laboratory quality</strong> is read only if the character has a sanctum linked</p></li><li><p><strong>Apprentice:</strong> put here the important stats of the apprentice that affect the lab total</p></li></ul><h3>Inventory</h3><p>Self-explanatory, note that Mundane and Magical book will be merged soon<br /><br />You can equip or unequip weapons and armor by clicking the checkbox</p><h3>Diary</h3><ul><li><p>List all diary entries in ante-chronological order (see @UUID[.x3UWNVGwHqQSh3sF]{Long term activities}).</p></li><li><p>Diary entries with an activity not yet applied will be in <em>italic.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Pending XP: </strong>This field will display the total XPs from activities which was not applied or distributed.<em><br /></em></p></li></ul><h3>Effects</h3><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/ActiveEffects.webp\" /><ul><li><p>See @UUID[.Gm3bQXMrk6WUTBaJ]{Active effects} for more details on each kind of effect available.</p></li><li><p>This tab is read only for players, hovering the mouse pointer on the icon will give a description of the effect</p></li><li><p>It will list the active effect on the character.</p></li><li><p>Clicking on the cross icon will temporarily disactivate it until the check march icon is clicked.</p></li><li><p>Some effects a read only even for a GM, this is because they are part of an Item owned by the character (eg: a Virtue).

Easy way to add a bunch of abilities, virtues and flaws to a character at creation. Note that</p><p><strong>Game metadata:</strong> Since the description cannot be made available for copyright reasons, most Item types available in the system Compendium are provided with the name of the sourcebook they are coming from and the page they can be found (English edition). Their display is managed by a setting (see @UUID[.pbpZGXKxANcTpr8R#settings]{Settings} )</p><p>A some of Item's types don't make sense for some Actor types (eg:Ability on a Covenant), they will be filtered and ignored.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Beside the name, speciality and description, the following fields are available. A * indicates this field is only visible when it is owned.</p><p><br /><strong>Name: </strong>A note of the name: it can be whatever you want, in the language you want. The system doesn't care about it. (see Ability key below).</p><p><strong>Score</strong>: it can either be adjusted using the plus and minus signs or by directly inputting the experience amount.</p><p><strong>Default characteristic:</strong> This selects the characteristic used by default when you roll that ability</p><p><strong>Ability key:</strong> This is an <strong>important</strong> information for the system. It allows it to know which ability it is independently of its name. This permits the system to do a lot of things:</p><ul><li><p>Check if a character has a specific ability and its score</p></li><li><p>Automatically use an ability's score to implement some rules or compute some value (eg: Parma Magica, penetration).</p></li><li><p>Know which ability to progress during a long term activity</p></li><li><p>And more as the system evolves</p></li></ul><p><strong>In short, if you don't configure it properly, some features won't work.</strong><br /></p><p><strong>Ability option:</strong> This field is greyed out most of the time, except for generic abilities. See below</p><p><strong>Active effects on abilities</strong></p><p>Abilities modified by an active effect have a coloured halo</p><div class=\"grid-2col\"><div><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/EffectsOnAbilities.webp\" /></div><div><p></p><p>Puissant ability</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Affinity with ability</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Affinity with ability and puissant ability</p><p><br /></p></div></div><h3>Generic abilities</h3><ul><li><p>Area lore, Organization lore, Languages (Dead or not), Craft, Profession, Mystery cult lore and supernatural power are generic abilities. They require an additional parameter to be recognized by the system, because there could be any number of them. Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to differentiate them.</p></li><li><p>Each generic ability with a different Ability option is totally independent of the others. It has its own speciality an default characteristic on rolls.</p></li><li><p>Generic abilities in Compendia should already have their option set (eg: Dead language (Latin) has \"Latin\" in its ability option).</p></li><li><p>The ability option is particularly useful when you want to add an affinity or puissant ability virtue. If you have multiple instance of an ability (eg: leatherwork and glassblowing, both craft abilities), using the option will allow to pick the correct one.</p></li><li><p><strong>Important</strong>: only alphanumeric characters are allowed for an ability option. The system will automatically remove other characters. Use CamelCase if you want to put multiple words.</p><p></p></li></ul><h2>Virtues and Flaws</h2><p><strong>Type</strong>: Some Actors will only accept virtues and flaws of a certain type.</p><p><strong>Impact</strong>: only used to keep track of how many points are used at character creation.</p><p><strong>Description: </strong>Usually empty (see FAQ), but in some cases there are active effects (see below) that need \"to be configured\". Look for that text before adding it.</p><h3>Effects:</h3><p>Virtues and flaws can have active effects which will be transmitted to their owner (see @UUID[.Gm3bQXMrk6WUTBaJ]{Active effects}). Whenever possible, those are already configured in the system Compendia (eg: the Large virtue will give +1 size).</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>Before V11, due to a Foundry core's limitation, it is not possible to edit active effects of an owned Item. You must edit it first in the sidebar. It is particularly relevant for effects that need configuration like Affinity, Puissant art, etc.</p><p></p><h2>Base effects</h2><p>The base effect is the root of any magical effect, spell or powers. They are intended to be used in the @UUID[.X4B31bvwKOCJefPn#codex-hermeticum-(violet)]{Codex Hermeticum}.</p><p><strong>Requisites</strong>:</p><p>You can select additional arts as requisites by clicking on the hammer icon:</p><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/Requisites.webp\" /><p>The <strong>base level</strong> is the level of a spell with this effect with minimal attributes (Range: self, Duration: Momentary, Target : individual). It is the same number found in the book for the spell guidelines.</p><h2>Magical effects</h2><p>A magical effect is like a spell and is designed like it. <br />The concept doesn't exist in the official rules, but it is used in the system to keep a collection of commonly used spontaneous effects for a character. Instead of designing it every time in play, it is ready to use.</p><p>See <strong>Spells</strong> below for more details about the fields</p><h2>Spells</h2><p><strong>Level: </strong>The level field is read only. It is computed from the base level and all the other attributes as per the rules.</p><p><strong>Spells attributes (Range, Duration, Target): </strong>By default, the list of available attributes is limited to those of the core book. However, using the <strong>sourcebook filter</strong> setting, you can expand the list to those present in other books (note that most of them have restriction for their use). The number in parenthesis is the amount of magnitudes the spell level will increase.</p><p><strong>Apply magical focus (owned): </strong>This is to indicate if the spell effect falls into the scope of any magical focus the character possesses. Casting total will be computed accordingly.</p><p><strong>Bonus and bonus description (owned): </strong>These fields are here to cover any specific bonus not covered by the system (yet). Examples: specialities of abilities like Artes liberales for rituals, Talisman bonuses,…</p><p><strong>Mastery (owned): </strong>Like abilities, you can change the score by using the plus and minus signs or directly put the total experience.</p><p><strong>Mastery abilities (owned)</strong>: Just a free form text field for now, but expect it to change in the future…</p><p><strong>General: </strong>If checked, it will display the field named <strong>Level Adjustment</strong></p><p><strong>Level Adjustment: </strong>this field allows to slightly adjust the level of a general spell so it is possible to have a value which is not a multiple of 5 (also useful for Aegis spell which doesn't follow the normal hermetic rules).</p><p><strong>Target size: </strong>Give information on what an Individual target is for each form.</p><p></p><h2>Powers</h2><p><strong>Form</strong>: used for magic resistance</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: used to compute penetration based on the owner might score.</p><h2>Enchantments</h2><p>Enchantments can be created from a magical effect or a spell using the @UUID[.X4B31bvwKOCJefPn#codex-hermeticum-(violet)]{Codex Hermeticum}.<br />There is an additional tab with new attributes specific to enchanting.</p><p><br /><strong>Dev notes</strong>: Enchanting as an activity is not yet implemented in the system, but the sheet can still be used for design as the level is still computed automatically.</p><h2>Diary entry</h2><p>This item can be used as a standard diary for the character but also to create @UUID[.x3UWNVGwHqQSh3sF]{long term activities} during down time between game sessions.</p><p><strong>Dev notes</strong>: the standard diary is still there for legacy reasons for people who used it as such in the past. I would recommend using a Foundry core JournalEntry for regular diaries as it is much easier to share between players or to do collaborative editing.</p><p></p><h2>Books</h2><p><br />Table of contents: Once you have finished defining all the topics of your book, you can generate the table of contents automatically by clicking the icon below the title (it will not erase anything in the description but append to it).</p><p>There two versions that can be generated:</p><ul><li><p>a concise one with just one click (1st one in the image below)</p></li><li><p>a verbose one by shift-click (2nd one in the image below)</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/book1.webp\" alt=\"A book\" /><p></p></li><li><p>A book can have multiple topics of different types, you can browse them using the arrows, adding one more with the + icon, delete the current one with the Perdo hand gesture.</p></li><li><p>The last icon will open a @UUID[.xpdDPJUjChabvRof#scriptorium]{Scriptorium} with all the book fields preset. If the book is owned, it will also preset the reader.</p><p>(For lab texts, the book needs to be in the inventory of the character or its sanctum</p><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/book2.webp\" /><p></p></li><li><p>Topic: You can select whether the book is about an Art, an ability, a spell mastery or a laboratory text</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>See @UUID[.5Jj2WDHaVKZPXOBV#generic-abilities]{Generic abilities} for more explanations about the ability option field</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>Weapon</h2><p><strong>Ability:</strong> The ability to apply when using the weapon.</p><p><strong>Weapon expert:</strong> Indicate the ability's specialty matches the weapon.</p><h2><br />Others</h2><p>There are more types of Items but they don't have any particular feature yet beside pure data.</p>",

If you wanted to use the book as a template, you can unlink it by clicking on the chain link icon and edit it again.</p></li><li><p>You can reset the reader by clicking on the chain link icon.</p></li><li><p>A faster and more convenient way to open the Scriptorium is from the book sheet (eye icon). The book will automatically be selected and if it is owned by a character, the reader too.</p></li><li><p>A number of checks are made before before being able to read a book:</p><ul><li><p>The \"reader\" must be able to read (ie: Artes Liberales 1+)</p></li><li><p>It must know a language at level 4. (It is too complex/impossible for the system to check whether it is the right language. Subject to GM approval)</p></li><li><p>The book level (for summa) must be greater than the reader skill in the topic.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The quality increase will be capped to the level of the book. You will be warned and any excess will be discarded.</p></li></ul><img src=\"systems/arm5e/assets/userguide/Scriptorium2.webp\" /><ul><li><p>For spell masteries and generic abilities, it is difficult to have an exact match of the name of the spell (eg: translation) or ability option.
