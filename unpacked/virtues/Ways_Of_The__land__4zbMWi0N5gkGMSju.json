    "description": "You have a deep understanding of a type of terrain, feeling more natural and at home there than anywhere else. Examples include Ways of the Forest, Ways of the Mountain, Ways of the Steppe or Ways of the Town. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls, including combat, that directly involve that area and its inhabitants; mundane, magical, or faerie. In addition, you roll one fewer botch die than normal (which may mean you roll no botch dice) in rolls that pertain to your area of understanding. You are not normally molested by animals of the terrain, and though particularly vicious creatures may still attack you, at least theyâ€™ll accord you proper respect. (For Ways of the Town, this still applies to town animals, of which there are plenty in the medieval world, rather than people. The +3 bonus does apply to people.) You may choose this Virtue multiple times, for different types of terrain. 50"
