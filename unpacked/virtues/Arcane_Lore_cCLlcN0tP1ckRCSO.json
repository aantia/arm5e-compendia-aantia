    "description": "You may take Arcane Abilities during character generation. Unless you have The Gift, you cannot learn Parma Magica. You get an additional 50 experience points, which must be spent on Arcane Abilities. A Gifted character who is not a Hermetic magus and knows Parma Magica must take the Major Story Flaw Enemy: Entire Order of Hermes, as magi are bound by their Oath to slay the character on sight, unless he immediately joins the Order. Such a character cannot be played in a normal saga, as the other player characters have to kill him."
