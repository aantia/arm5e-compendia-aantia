    "description": "You can do more with spontaneous magic than most magi at the cost of your own life energy. When you decide to use this ability in casting a spontaneous spell, you declare the level of effect you wish to produce before rolling. This level may include a number of levels of penetration (see page 82). For example, you can choose to cast a level 10 effect at level 20, to give a penetration of 10 plus your Penetration score. Roll to cast a fatiguing spontaneous spell. If your result is higher than the level you declared, you spend only one Fatigue level as usual. If your result is less than the level you declared, you must expend one additional Fatigue level per five points (or fraction thereof) by which you missed the target level. If you run out of Fatigue levels, you take a wound. The number of levels still needed for the spell is treated as the amount by which a damage total exceeds your soak, and you take the corresponding wound. You can kill yourself this way. A maga with this Virtue may still cast fatiguing spontaneous spells normally.",
