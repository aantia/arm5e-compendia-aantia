    "description": "You have a magical cloak, animal skin or similar item made from an animal. While in physical contact with it, you may transform into the form of the animal represented by the item. The transformation takes one full round, and you retain both intelligence and sentience while in animal form. Clothing and possessions (save the animal item) do not transform, and you may be seen as a transformed human with InAn or InCo, or similar spells. If the item is stolen, the new owner has an Arcane Connection to you, and you may not transform until the item is retrieved. If the item is destroyed, you can make a new one over the course of a season, although the method varies depending on what the item is. Skinchangers may transform into any non-magical animal between Size â€“5 (robin) and Size +2 (bear). The character has the normal physical characteristics of the animal, except that +3 is added to the characters Soak score (in animal form only)."
