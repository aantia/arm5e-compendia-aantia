    "description": "Your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature (solar, lunar, or seasonal, for example) and as such, is more potent at specific times. At those times, you receive a +3 bonus to all spell rolls. The bonus also applies to Lab Totals if the positive part of the cycle covers the whole season. The cycle of your magic must be regular and approved by the storyguide. Furthermore, the length of time when the bonus applies must be equal to the amount of time when it does not."
