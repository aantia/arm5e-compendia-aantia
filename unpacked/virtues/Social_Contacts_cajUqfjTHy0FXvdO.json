    "description": "You have a broad range of acquaintances in a specific social circle (specified when this Virtue is purchased), accumulated over years of travel and socializing. Almost everywhere you go, you meet someone you know, or can get in touch with someone who can help you. Whenever you are somewhere new, you can contact someone on a simple Presence roll against an Ease Factor of 6. The storyguide may modify this target number upward for very small areas or areas where it is extremely unlikely that you would know someone. You may purchase this Virtue more than once, each time specifying a different social group."
