    "description": "Your magic is particularly attuned to some narrow field, such as self-transformation, birds of prey, or healing. In general, the field should be slightly narrower than a single Technique and Form combination, although it may include restricted areas of several such combinations. Healing, for example, is a part of Creo Corpus, Creo Animal, and possibly Creo Herbam. You cannot be focused on a laboratory activity, such as creating charged items, although a focus does apply to laboratory activities. When you cast a spell or generate a Lab Total within your focus, add the lowest applicable Art score twice, as for a Major Magical Focus (page 45). A magus may only have one Magical Focus, whether major or minor, regardless of the source of the focus.\nSample Minor Magical Foci \nThis list is merely exemplary; other foci are possible. \nAnimal: Birds of prey, canines, mustelidae. \nAquam: Stagnant water, small streams. \nAuram: Wind, rain, lightning. \nCorpus: Aging, disease. \nHerbam: Fruiting, wood. \nImaginem: A particular color or sound. \nMentem: Anger, lust, erasing memories, changing memories. \nTerram: Creating metals, destroying stone. \nHealing: Applies to people, animals, and plants. \nSelf-Transformation: Applies to both Corpus and Mentem.
