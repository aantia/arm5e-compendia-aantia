    "description": "You grew up in an environment where you had access to teachers and free time for study. You have an additional 50 experience points, which may be spent on General, Academic, or Martial Abilities. You may not, however, buy Academic or Martial Abilities with your normal pool of experience points unless you have another Virtue or Flaw permitting that. The most common reason for this Virtue is that your family was wealthy while you were a child, but if you are wealthy now, you should take the Wealthy Virtue."
