    "description": "You were once apprenticed to a mage, but something kept you from completing your studies. Perhaps your Gift was incomplete or some grievous mishap robbed you of it altogether. You may still work for your former master or for the covenant in some other capacity. Magi welcome you and have compassion for you â€” those who are given to such emotions, anyway. You may learn Academic and Arcane Abilities during character creation, and you are familiar with the lives of magi. You may not have The Gift, but if your Gift was not completely destroyed, you may have some Supernatural Abilities. You may learn Magic Theory and serve a magus as a laboratory assistant. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. This Virtue is available to male and female characters.",
