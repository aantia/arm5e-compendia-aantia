    "description": "You are a rich member of your class. You may spend three seasons per year on study or adventuring, as you can pay people to look after your interests, and these seasons are genuinely free. Exactly how wealthy you are depends on your social class; a noble would have at least a dozen servants, including some bodyguards, while a wealthy townsman would have a good house and maybe three servants. Whatever your class, you are wealthy enough to afford goods generally associated with a higher class, and thus risk being labeled a vulgar social climber. Wealthy characters may live at a covenant, but they are not supported by the covenant. As all Hermetic magi are supported by their covenant, no magi may take this Virtue. WELL-TRAVELED Minor, General You have journeyed extensively in this part of the world and find it easy to get along with people throughout the area. You have fifty bonus experience points to spend on living languages, Area Lores, and Bargain, Carouse, Charm, Etiquette, Folk Ken, or Guile."
