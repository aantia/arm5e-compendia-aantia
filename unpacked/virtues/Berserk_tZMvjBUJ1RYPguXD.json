    "description": "You are capable of entering a blinding rage when in combat or frustrating situations. You automatically gain the Personality Trait Angry +2 (or more, at your option). Any time you take a wound or wound an enemy, roll a stress die and add your Angry score. A roll of 9+ means you go berserk. The storyguide can also call for a roll when you are strongly frustrated. You may deliberately try to go berserk. In this case, you only need a 6+ when you take a wound or wound an enemy, or a 9+ if you have not been wounded or caused a wound. While berserk, you get +2 to Attack and Soak scores, but suffer a –2 penalty to Defense. While berserk, you cannot retreat, hesitate to attack, or give quarter. If you are still berserk when there are no enemies present, you attack your friends. You may roll once per round to calm down if you desire, requiring a stress die + Perception — Angry against an Ease Factor of 6. You may learn Martial Abilities at character creation."
