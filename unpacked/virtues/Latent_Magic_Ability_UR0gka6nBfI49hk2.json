    "description": "You have a magical quality that has not yet manifested itself. You probably do not realize you have this capacity; if you are a magus, your master failed to detect it during your apprenticeship. At the storyguides discretion, this quality might appear spontaneously or because of some relevant event (like drinking faerie wine). This is not The Gift, and the latent ability is more limited than that. 44"
