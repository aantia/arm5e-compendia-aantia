    "description": "You are able to improve a particular Ability through the expedient of repeated failure. The first time in a given game session that you botch a roll or fail by exactly one point, you gain five experience points in the Ability. The roll must have come up naturally in the course of the story. You may take this Virtue several times, once for each Ability chosen."
