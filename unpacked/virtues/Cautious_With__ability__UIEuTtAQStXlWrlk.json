    "description": "You are very careful with a specific Ability, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail when using it. You roll two fewer botch dice than normal whenever you are required to roll botch dice for that Ability. This may mean that you roll no botch dice. This Virtue may apply to any Ability, even one you cannot learn at character creation."
