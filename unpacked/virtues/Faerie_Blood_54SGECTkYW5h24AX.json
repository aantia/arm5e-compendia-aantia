    "description": "Somewhere in your ancestry there is a faerie, and this relation gives you an intuitive grasp of the motivations and personalities of those mystical folk. Faeries are more comfortable around you than around other humans, and given time, may even forget the mortal blood in your veins. You are resistant to aging, and get â€“1 to all aging rolls. Type of Faerie Blood (pick one, or create a similar one): Dwarf Blood: You are descended from the master craftsmen of the fay, and get a +1 bonus to any total including a Craft Ability. Goblin Blood: Your ancestors were the sneaky inhabitants of the shadows underground, and you get a +1 bonus on all totals involving stealth. Satyr Blood: The satyrs are notoriously lecherous. \tYou \tget \ta \t+1 \tbonus \tto Communication and Presence totals when dealing with sexually compatible characters. Sidhe Blood: You are descended from one of the noble fay who rule the lands of Summer and sunlight. Because of the striking and unusual qualities of your nature add +1 to your Presence, but not to more than +3. Many mortals may consider you fascinating or alluring. Undine Blood: The undines are the faeries of the water, and you get a +2 bonus to any action taken underwater, which will partially offset any penalty applied. Characters with Faerie Blood can learn Faerie Lore at character generation.",
