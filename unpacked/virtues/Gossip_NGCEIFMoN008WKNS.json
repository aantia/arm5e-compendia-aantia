    "description": "You have regular social contacts in the area that provide you with all kinds of information about local social and political goings-on. On a simple roll of 6+, you hear interesting news before almost everyone else. You treat all local Reputations as twice their actual level. With some well-placed words, you may be able to bestow new Reputations (whether deserved or not). You quite likely have a Reputation, too â€” as a gossip."
