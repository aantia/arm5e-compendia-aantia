    "description": "You are very careful with magic, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail. You roll three fewer botch dice when casting 40 spells (either spontaneous or formulaic), and when working in the laboratory. This Virtue may not reduce the number of botch dice rolled below one. However, its effects are applied before any other effects which reduce botch dice, such as spell mastery (see page 86), and they may reduce the number of botch dice to zero."
