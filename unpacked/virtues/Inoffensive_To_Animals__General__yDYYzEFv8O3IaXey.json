    "description": "Your Gift does not bother animals, although it still has the normal effects on people. Animals with a Might score might react either way, depending on the animal. As a rule, if the animal reacts positively to The Gift most of the time, it reacts positively to you because you do have The Gift. If it reacts negatively, this Virtue over-rides it. UnGifted characters may take this Virtue if they have the Flaw Magical Air (page 56).",
