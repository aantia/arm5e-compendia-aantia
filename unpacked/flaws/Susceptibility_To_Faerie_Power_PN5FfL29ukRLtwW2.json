    "description": "You are especially susceptible to the fay and their magic. Whenever you enter a faerie area, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than its aura rating to avoid becoming disoriented. In addition, your Magic Resistance score, including Parma Magica, against faerie magic is halved. If someone else uses their Parma Magica to protect you, their resistance is not affected and you benefit normally.",
