    "description": "You are completely unable to learn a certain class of Abilities, for some reason. This may be Martial Abilities, or a more limited set of the others. A profound inability to master logic   would   rule   out   Artes   Liberales, Philosophiae,   any   Law,     Medicine,   and Theology. Alternatively, you might be unable to learn any languages other than your native tongue. It must be possible for your character to learn the abilities in question, but she need have no intention of doing so. You may only take this Flaw once.",
