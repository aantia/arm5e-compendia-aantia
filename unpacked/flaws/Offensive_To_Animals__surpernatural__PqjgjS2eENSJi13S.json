Characters with The Gift may only take this Flaw if they have the Gentle Gift, in which case only humans react to them as if they didnâ€™t have The Gift. Animals with a Might score react in different ways. In general, those that react negatively to The Gift react negatively to you, while those that react positively do not, unless you actually have The Gift.",
