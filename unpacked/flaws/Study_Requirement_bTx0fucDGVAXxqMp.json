    "description": "You are unable to study magic from books or vis alone. You must study in the presence of the appropriate Art. For example, you need to sit next to a brook or pond to study Aquam, or a large fire to study Ignem. Growing things are good for Creo, decaying ones good for Perdo. As your knowledge grows, you need to work with larger and larger quantities. See “Study Bonus Virtue” on page 49 for a list of examples. You may take Study Bonus and Study Requirement.",
