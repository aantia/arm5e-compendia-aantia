    "description": "You grew up in the wilderness, either raised by wild animals or surviving on your own. For much of your life you could not speak, and knew nothing of human ways. Now that you have joined human society (or the covenant), you have learned to understand some basic spoken phrases, but civilized life is still a mystery you want little part of. You may only choose beginning Abilities that you could have learned in the wilds. In particular, you may not start with a score in a Language. In your first five years you gain 120 experience points, which must be split between (Area) Lore, Animal Handling, Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Hunt, Stealth, Survival, and Swim.",
