Long hikes are likewise beyond your capability. You are unable to learn Martial Abilities or any other skills involving physical exertion, since you cannot train in them. If you are a magus, you lose double the normal number of Fatigue levels from casting spells, but you may carry out laboratory activities as normal.",
