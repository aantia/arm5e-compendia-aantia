    "description": "You have an ally among the fay. How much assistance you can get depends on the power of the friend â€” a small faerie with (relatively) minor powers can accompany you on a day to day basis. Powerful faeries have other business, and may only be available to answer questions and provide guidance, not to accompany you around on your adventures. Your ally is fully sentient, has its own powers, and can speak when it chooses. You may want to have another player act the part. While a faerie companion can be a great boon, it can also be a terrible burden. If it is nasty or mischievous, it could cause trouble for you everywhere. Characters with this Flaw can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.",
