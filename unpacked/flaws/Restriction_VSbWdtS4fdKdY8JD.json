    "description": "You cannot cast spells at all under certain uncommon conditions. These might refer to your state, such as touching the earth directly or having no beard, or to the target, such as birds or glass, or to your location when you use the magic, such as on a small boat or in a storm. The Restriction also applies to effects generated by any enchanted items you create. Spells cast remain in effect even if the Restriction comes into play. Thus, if your Restriction is that you must not have a beard, you cast a spell with Year duration, and then grow a beard, the spell does not fail.",
