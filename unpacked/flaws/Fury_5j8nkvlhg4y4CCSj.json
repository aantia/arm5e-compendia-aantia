    "description": "A violent temper sometimes overwhelms you, sending you into a destructive, uncontrollable rage. You are likely to be provoked by some sort of specific event, such as being insulted, being hurt, or hearing the Order of Hermes disparaged. Roll 9+ on a stress die to avoid flying into a rage when such an event occurs, with another roll every round to try to calm yourself should you fail the first. On a botch, you try to kill everyone around you. While enraged you get +3 to Damage, but â€“1 on all other scores and rolls.",
