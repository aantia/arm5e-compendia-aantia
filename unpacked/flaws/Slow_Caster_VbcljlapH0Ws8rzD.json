    "description": "Your magic requires more time to prepare and execute than that of other magi. Your formulaic spells take two rounds to cast; spontaneous spells also take two rounds unless you fast-cast, in which case they take one round casting time. Fast-cast mastered spells also take the normal one-round time. Ritual spells are performed as normal, since all magi must cast them slowly and carefully.",
